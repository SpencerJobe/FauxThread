FauxThread
==========

A hack-ish thread pooling module for JavaScript. This is my first post on GitHub. 


FauxThread allows you to do the following :

1.	Execute functions without locking up the browser
2.	Execute multiple functions at the same time
3.	Execute AJAX without callback functions
4.	Suspend execution until an expression yields true
5.	Runtime inter-thread communication 
6.	Runtime DOM access
7.	Runtime mutation
